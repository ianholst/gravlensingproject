abstract = {The Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile is often used to model gravitational lenses. For low values of the characteristic convergence ({\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashll 1{\$}) of this model - corresponding to galaxy and galaxy group mass scales - a high numerical precision is required in order to accurately compute several quantities in the strong lensing regime. An alternative for fast and accurate computations is to derive analytic approximations in this limit. In this work we obtain analytic solutions for several lensing quantities for elliptical (ENFW) and pseudo-elliptical (PNFW) NFW lens models on the typical scales where gravitational arcs are expected to be formed, in the {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashll 1{\$} limit, establishing their domain of validity. We derive analytic solutions for the convergence and shear for these models, obtaining explicit expressions for the iso-convergence contours and constant distortion curves (including the tangential critical curve). We also compute the deformation cross section, which is given in closed form for the circular NFW model and in terms of a one-dimensional integral for the elliptical ones. In addition, we provide a simple expression for the ellipticity of the iso-convergence contours of the pseudo-elliptical models and the connection of characteristic convergences among the PNFW and ENFW models. We conclude that the set of solutions derived here is generally accurate for {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashlesssim 0.1{\$}. For low ellipticities, values up to {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashsimeq 0.18{\$} are allowed. On the other hand, the mapping between PNFW and the ENFW models is valid up to {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashsimeq 0.4{\$}. The solutions derived in this work can be used to speed up numerical codes and ensure their accuracy in the low {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s{\$} regime, including applications to arc statistics and other strong lensing observables.

abstract = {Halo masses and concentrations have been studied extensively, by means of N-body simulations as well as observationally, during the last decade. Nevertheless, the exact form of the mass-concentration relation is still widely debated. One of the most promising method to estimate masses and concentrations relies on gravitational lensing from massive halos. Here we investigate the impact of the mass-concentration relation on halo peak abundance in weak lensing shear maps relying on the aperture mass method for peak detections. After providing a prescription to take into account the concentration dispersion (always neglected in previous works) in peak number counts predictions, we assess their power to constrain the mass-concentration relation by means of Fisher matrix technique. We find that, when combined with different cosmological probes, peak statistics information from near-future weak lensing surveys provides an interesting and complementary alternative method to lessen the long standing controversy about the mass-concentration relation.},

abstract = {The existence of an arc statistics problem was at the center of a strong debate in the last fifteen years. With the aim to clarify if the optical depth for giant gravitational arcs by galaxy clusters in the so called concordance model is compatible with observations, several studies were carried out which helped to significantly improve our knowledge of strong lensing clusters, unveiling their extremely complex internal structure. In particular, the abundance and the frequency of strong lensing events like gravitational arcs turned out to be a potentially very powerful tool to trace the structure formation. However, given the limited size of observational and theoretical data-sets, the power of arc statistics as a cosmological tool has been only minimally exploited so far. On the other hand, the last years were characterized by significant advancements in the field, and several cluster surveys that are ongoing or planned for the near future seem to have the potential to make arc statistics a competitive cosmological probe. Additionally, recent observations of anomalously large Einstein radii and concentrations in galaxy clusters have reinvigorated the debate on the arc statistics problem. In this paper, we review the work done so far on arc statistics, focussing on what is the lesson we learned and what is likely to improve in the next years.},

abstract = {Integral measures of weak gravitational lensing by dark-matter haloes, like the aperture mass, are sensitive to different physical halo properties dependent on the halo mass density profile. For isothermal profiles, the relation between aperture mass and virial mass is steeper than for haloes with the universal NFW profile. Consequently, the halo mass range probed by the aperture mass is much wider for NFW than for isothermal haloes. We use recent modifications to the Press-Schechter mass function in CDM models normalised to the local abundance of rich clusters, to predict the properties of the halo sample expected to be accessible with the aperture mass technique. While {\~{}}10 haloes should be detected per square degree if the haloes have NFW profiles, their number density is lower by approximately an order of magnitude if they have isothermal profiles. These results depend only very mildly on the cosmological background model. We conclude that counts of haloes with a significant weak-lensing signal are a powerful discriminator between different dark-matter profiles.},

abstract = {This paper exploits the gravitational magnification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to measure properties of dark matter haloes. Gravitationally magnified and de-magnified SNe Ia should be brighter and fainter than average, respectively. The magnification of individual SNe Ia can be computed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halo models. We model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singular isothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeying luminosity-dependent scaling laws. A homogeneously selected sample of 175 SNe Ia from the first 3 yr of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) in the redshift range 0.2 [lsim]z[lsim] 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloes associated with foreground galaxies. The best-fitting velocity dispersion scaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We further find that the normalization of the velocity dispersion of passive and star-forming galaxies are consistent with empirical Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher relations, respectively. If we make no assumption on the normalization of these relations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 per cent confidence level. Using recent models of dust extinction, we deduce that the impact of this effect on our results is very small. We also investigate the brightness scatter of SNe Ia due to gravitational lensing, which has implications for SN Ia cosmology. The gravitational lensing scatter is approximately proportional to the SN Ia redshift. We find the constant of proportionality to be B[{\~{}}=] 0.055+0.039-0.041 mag (B[lsim] 0.12 mag at the 95 per cent confidence level). If this model is correct, the contribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of SNe Ia is small for the SNLS sample. According to the best-fitting dark matter model, gravitational lensing should, however, contribute significantly to the brightness scatter at z{\{}gtrsim{\}} 1.6.},

abstract = {We present the results of a study of weak lensing by galaxies based on 45.5 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} of {\$}R{\_}C{\$} band imaging data from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS). We present the first weak lensing detection of the flattening of galaxy dark matter halos. We use a simple model in which the ellipticity of the halo is {\$}f{\$} times the observed ellipticity of the lens. We find a best fit value of {\$}f=0.77{\^{}}{\{}+0.18{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.21{\}}{\$}, suggesting that the dark matter halos are somewhat rounder than the light distribution. The fact that we detect a significant flattening implies that the halos are well aligned with the light distribution. Given the average ellipticity of the lenses, this implies a halo ellipticity of {\$}{\textless}e{\_}{\{}\backslashrm halo{\}} {\textgreater}=0.33{\^{}}{\{}+0.07{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.09{\}}{\$}, in fair agreement with results from numerical simulations of CDM. This result provides strong support for the existence of dark matter, as an isotropic lensing signal is excluded with 99.5{\%} confidence. We also study the average mass profile around the lenses, using a maximum likelihood analysis. We consider two models for the halo mass profile: a truncated isothermal sphere (TIS) and an NFW profile. We adopt observationally motivated scaling relations between the lens luminosity and the velocity dispersion and the extent of the halo. The best fit NFW model yields a mass {\$}M{\_}{\{}200{\}}=(8.4\backslashpm0.7\backslashpm0.4)\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and a scale radius {\$}r{\_}s=16.2{\^{}}{\{}+3.6{\}}{\_}{\{}-2.9{\}} h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} kpc.

abstract = {Splashback refers to the process of matter that is accreting onto a dark matter halo reaching its first orbital apocenter and turning around in its orbit. The cluster-centric radius at which this process occurs, r{\_}sp, defines a halo boundary that is connected to the dynamics of the cluster, in contrast with other common halo boundary definitions such as R{\_}200. A rapid decline in the matter density profile of the halo is expected near r{\_}sp. We measure the galaxy number density and weak lensing mass profiles around RedMapper galaxy clusters in the first year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. For a cluster sample with mean mass {\~{}}2.5 x 10{\^{}}14 solar masses, we find strong evidence of a splashback-like steepening of the galaxy density profile and measure r{\_}sp=1.16 +/- 0.08 Mpc/h, consistent with earlier SDSS measurements of More et al. (2016) and Baxter et al. (2017). Moreover, our weak lensing measurement demonstrates for the first time the existence of a splashback-like steepening of the matter profile of galaxy clusters. We measure r{\_}sp=1.28 +/- 0.18 Mpc/h from the weak lensing data, in good agreement with our galaxy density measurements. Applying our analysis to different cluster and galaxy samples, we find that consistent with LambdaCDM simulations, r{\_}sp scales with R{\_}200m and does not evolve with redshift over the redshift range of 0.3--0.6. We also find that potential systematic effects associated with the RedMapper algorithm may impact the location of r{\_}sp, in particular the choice of scale used to estimate cluster richness. We discuss progress needed to understand the systematic uncertainties and fully exploit forthcoming data from DES and future surveys, emphasizing the importance of more realistic mock catalogs and independent cluster samples.},

abstract = {Strong lensing is a powerful probe of the distribution of matter in the cores of clusters of galaxies. Recent studies suggest that the cold dark matter model predicts cores that are denser than those observed in galaxies, groups and clusters. One possible resolution of the discrepancy is that the dark matter has strong interactions (SIDM), which leads to lower central densities. A generalized form of the Navarro, Frenk and White profile (Zhao profile) may be used to describe these halos. In this paper we examine gravitational lensing statistics for this class of model. The optical depth to multiple imaging is a very sensitive function of the profile parameters in the range of interest for SIDM halos around clusters of galaxies. Less concentrated profiles, which result from larger self-interaction cross-sections, can produce many fewer lensed pairs. Lensing statistics provide a powerful test for SIDM. More realistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to be done, however larger self-interaction cross-sections may well be ruled out by the very existence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster scales. The inclusion of centrally dominant cluster galaxies should boost the cross-section to multiple imaging. However our preliminary calculations suggest that the additional multiple imaging rate is small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging rate for different halo profiles. In future statistical studies, it will be important to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles since the optical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most concentrated members of a cluster population.},

abstract = {In this paper we use a recently compiled data set, which comprises 118 galactic-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems to constrain the statistic property of SGL system, as well as the curvature of universe without assuming any fiducial cosmological model. Based on the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model of SGL system, we obtain that the constrained curvature parameter {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm k{\}}{\$} is close to zero from the SGL data, which is consistent with the latest result of planck measurement. More interestingly, we find that the parameter {\$}f{\$} in the SIE model is strongly correlated with the curvature {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm k{\}}{\$}. Neglecting this correlation in the analysis will significantly overestimate the constraining power of SGL data on the curvature. Furthermore, the obtained constraint on {\$}f{\$} is different from previous results: {\$}f=1.105\backslashpm0.030{\$} ({\$}68\backslash{\%}{\$} C.L.), which means that the standard singular isothermal sphere (SIS) model ({\$}f=1{\$}) is disfavored by the current SGL data at more than {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} confidence level. We also divide the whole SGL data into two parts according to the centric stellar velocity dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm c{\}}{\$} and find that the larger value of {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm c{\}}{\$} the subsample has, the more favored the standard SIS model is.

abstract = {We present a maximum-likelihood analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing effects in galaxy clusters and in the field. The aim is to determine the accuracy and robustness of constraints that can be obtained on galaxy halo properties in both environments - the high density cluster and the low density field. This paper is theoretically motivated, therefore, we work exclusively with simulated data (nevertheless defined to match observations) to study the accuracy with which input parameters for mass distributions for galaxies can be extracted. We model galaxies in the cluster and the field using a wide range of mass profiles: the truncated pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution, the Navarro, Frenk and White profile, and a Power Law model with a core radius. We find that independent of the choice of profile the mean mass of galaxies (of the order of 10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}Mo) can be estimated to within 15{\%} from ground-based data and with an error of less than 10{\%} with space observations. Additionally robust constraints can be obtained on the mean slope of the mass profile. The two standard parameters that characterise galaxy halo models, the central velocity dispersion and the truncation radius can also be retrieved reliably from the maximum-likelihood analysis. Furthermore, going beyond the usual formulation, we propose a re-parameterisation of the mass models that allows us to put yet stronger constraints on the aperture mass of a galaxy halo (with less than 10{\%} error). The gain in signal to noise using space observations, expected for instance with the proposed SNAP satellite compared to ground based data in terms of accuracy of retrieving input parameters is highly significant.},
