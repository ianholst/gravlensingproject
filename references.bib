abstract = {The postcollapse structure of objects which form by gravitational condensation out of the expanding cosmological background universe is a key element in the theory of galaxy formation. Towards this end, we have reconsidered the outcome of the nonlinear growth of a uniform, spherical density perturbation in an unperturbed background universe - the cosmological ``top-hat'' problem. We adopt the usual assumption that the collapse to infinite density at a finite time predicted by the top-hat solution is interrupted by a rapid virialization caused by the growth of small-scale inhomogeneities in the initial perturbation. We replace the standard description of the postcollapse object as a uniform sphere in virial equilibrium by a more self-consistent one as a truncated, nonsingular, isothermal sphere in virial and hydrostatic equilibrium, including for the first time a proper treatment of the finite-pressure boundary condition on the sphere. The results differ significantly from both the uniform sphere and the singular isothermal sphere approximations for the postcollapse objects. These results will have a significant effect on a wide range of applications of the Press-Schechter and other semi-analytical models to cosmology. The truncated isothermal sphere solution presented here predicts the virial temperature and integrated mass distribution of the X-ray clusters formed in the CDM model as found by detailed, 3D, numerical gas and N-body dynamical simulations remarkably well. This solution allows us to derive analytically the numerically-calibrated mass-temperature and radius-temperature scaling laws for X-ray clusters which were derived empirically by Evrard, Metzler and Navarro from simulation results for the CDM model.

abstract = {We study a large set of high spatial resolution optical rotation curves of galaxies with the goal of determining the model parameters for a disk embedded within a CDM halo that we model either with a NFW profile or pseudo-isothermal profile. We show that parameter degeneracies present in lower resolution data are lifted at these higher resolutions. 34{\%} of the galaxies do not have a meaningful fit when using the NFW profile and 32{\%} when using the pseudoisothermal profile, however only 14{\%} do not have a meaningful fit in either model. In both models we find correlations between the disk baryon fraction {\$}f{\_}d{\$} and the spin parameter of the halo {\$}\backslashlambda'{\$}, between {\$}f{\_}d{\$} and the dark halo mass {\$}M{\_}{\{}200{\}}{\$}, and between {\$}M{\_}{\{}200{\}}{\$} and the concentration parameter {\$}c{\$}. We show that the distribution of the concentration parameters {\$}c{\$}, for a NFW halo, is in good agreement with CDM predictions; no significant galaxy population is found with very low values of {\$}c{\$}. The overall distribution of {\$}\backslashlambda'{\$} is in good agreement with theoretical predictions from hierarchical tidal torque theory. The whole sample is also well fitted by a pseudo-isothermal dark halo with a core, but the size of the core is rather small (for 70{\%} of the sample the core size is less than 2 kpc). Thus we conclude that the profile of dark matter is steep ({\$}r{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} or steeper) down to this radius; large dark matter cores (and therefore very low dark matter central densities) seem to be excluded. LSBs tend to have higher values of {\$}\backslashlambda'{\$} for a given {\$}f{\_}d{\$} and lower values of {\$}c{\$} for a given mass than HSBs. In an appendix we give some useful formula for pseudo-isothermal profile halos and discuss in detail the issue of parameter degeneracies.},

abstract = {One of the most powerful techniques to study the dark sector of the Universe is weak gravitational lensing. In practice, to infer the reduced shear, weak lensing measures galaxy shapes, which are the consequence of both the intrinsic ellipticity of the sources and of the integrated gravitational lensing effect along the line of sight. Hence, a very large number of galaxies is required in order to average over their individual properties and to isolate the weak lensing cosmic shear signal. If this `shape noise' can be reduced, significant advances in the power of a weak lensing surveys can be expected. This paper describes a general method for extracting the probability distributions of parameters from catalogues of data using Voronoi cells, which has several applications, and has synergies with Bayesian hierarchical modelling approaches. This allows us to construct a probability distribution for the variance of the intrinsic ellipticity as a function of galaxy property using only photometric data, allowing a reduction of shape noise. As a proof of concept the method is applied to the CFHTLenS survey data. We use this approach to investigate trends of galaxy properties in the data and apply this to the case of weak lensing power spectra.},

abstract = {Using a large set of ray-tracing in N-body simulations, we examine lensing profiles around massive dark haloes in detail, with a particular emphasis on the profile at around the virial radii. We compare radial convergence profiles, which are measured accurately in the ray-tracing simulations by stacking many dark haloes, with our simple analytic model predictions. Our analytic models consist of a main halo, which is modelled by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile with three different forms of the truncation, plus the correlated matter (2-halo term) around the main halo. We find that the smoothly truncated NFW profile best reproduces the simulated lensing profiles, out to more than 10 times the virial radius. We then use this analytic model to investigate potential biases in cluster weak lensing studies in which a single, untruncated NFW component is usually assumed in interpreting observed signals. We find that cluster masses, inferred by fitting reduced tangential shear profiles with the NFW profile, tend to be underestimated by {\~{}}5-10{\%} if fitting is performed out to {\~{}}10'-30'. In contrast, the concentration parameter is overestimated typically by {\~{}}20{\%} for the same fitting range. We also investigate biases in computing the signal-to-noise ratio of weak lensing mass peaks, finding them to be {\textless}4{\%} for significant mass peaks. In the Appendices, we provide useful formulae for the smoothly truncated NFW profile.},

abstract = {Future weak lensing surveys potentially hold the highest statistical power for constraining cosmological parameters compared to other cosmological probes. The statistical power of a weak lensing survey is determined by the sky coverage, the inverse of the noise in shear measurements, and the galaxy number density. The combination of the latter two factors is often expressed in terms of {\$}n{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\$} -- the "effective number density of galaxies used for weak lensing measurements". In this work, we estimate {\$}n{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\$} for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project, the most powerful ground-based lensing survey planned for the next two decades. We investigate how the following factors affect the resulting {\$}n{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\$} of the survey with detailed simulations: (1) survey time, (2) shear measurement algorithm, (3) algorithm for combining multiple exposures, (4) inclusion of data from multiple filter bands, (5) redshift distribution of the galaxies, and (6) masking and blending. For the first time, we quantify in a general weak lensing analysis pipeline the sensitivity of {\$}n{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\$} to the above factors. We find that with current weak lensing algorithms, expected distributions of observing parameters, and all lensing data ({\$}r{\$}- and {\$}i{\$}-band, covering 18,000 degree{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} of sky) for LSST, {\$}n{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} \backslashapprox37{\$} arcmin{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} before considering blending and masking, {\$}n{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} \backslashapprox31{\$} arcmin{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} when rejecting seriously blended galaxies and {\$}n{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} \backslashapprox26{\$} arcmin{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} when considering an additional 15{\%} loss of galaxies due to masking. With future improvements in weak lensing algorithms, these values could be expected to increase by up to 20{\%}. Throughout the paper, we also stress the ways in which {\$}n{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\$} depends on our ability to understand and control systematic effects in the measurements.},

abstract = {While both isothermal and NFW-based mass models for galaxy clusters are widely adopted in strong-lensing studies, they cannot easily be distinguished based solely on observed positions of arcs and arclets. We compare the magnifications predicted for giant arcs obtained from isothermal and NFW profiles, taking axially-symmetric and asymmetric mass distributions into account. We find that arc magnifications can differ strongly between the two types of density profiles even if the image morphology is well reproduced. Magnifications by lenses with NFW density profiles are usually larger than those for lenses with singular or nearly singular isothermal density profiles, unless the latter have large cores. Asymmetries play an important role. We illustrate our results with the two well-studied clusters MS 2137 and A{\~{}}370. We confirm earlier results showing that both isothermal and NFW mass models can very well reproduce the observed arcs, radial arcs and other arclets. While the mass model for MS 2137 is not very well constrained, the two types of mass models produce strongly differing critical curves and caustics for A{\~{}}370. We find that the NFW mass profile is preferred for A{\~{}}370. We identify new arclet candidates in the field of A{\~{}}370. Redshift estimates allowed by the lens model are consistent with results in the literature, where available. Three newly found counter-images are suggested to arise from an active, dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxy at {\$}z\backslashapprox1.1{\$}.},

abstract = {Navarro, Frenk, $\backslash${\&} White have recently found numerically that the density profile of dark-matter halos can be described by a universal two-parameter function over a broad range of halo masses. The profile is singular, approaching the halo center with {\$}\backslashrho\backslashpropto r{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. It had been argued previously that radially distorted, gravitationally lensed images of background sources in galaxy clusters, so-called radial arcs, required a flat core in the cluster density profile. Such radial arcs have so far been detected in two galaxy clusters, in apparent contradiction with a singular density profile. I show here that the profile suggested by Navarro et al. can produce radial arcs despite its central singularity, and describe how the two parameters of the profile can be determined in clusters where radial and tangential arcs are observed. I then apply this analysis to the two clusters where radial arcs were detected. In both cases, the redshifts of the radial arcs are yet unknown, hence definitive conclusions on the profile parameters cannot yet be drawn. Numerically determined values for the parameters of cluster-sized halos can, however, be used to predict the range of the unknown arc redshifts, thus providing a direct observational test for the proposed density profile. A potential difficulty with the profile is that the radial magnification of tangential arcs is large, hence tangential arcs should be thick or their sources should be very thin in the radial direction.},

abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega{\_}m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n{\_}s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68{\%} errors on measured parameters and 95{\%} limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N{\_} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega{\_}K| {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {The Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile is often used to model gravitational lenses. For low values of the characteristic convergence ({\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashll 1{\$}) of this model - corresponding to galaxy and galaxy group mass scales - a high numerical precision is required in order to accurately compute several quantities in the strong lensing regime. An alternative for fast and accurate computations is to derive analytic approximations in this limit. In this work we obtain analytic solutions for several lensing quantities for elliptical (ENFW) and pseudo-elliptical (PNFW) NFW lens models on the typical scales where gravitational arcs are expected to be formed, in the {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashll 1{\$} limit, establishing their domain of validity. We derive analytic solutions for the convergence and shear for these models, obtaining explicit expressions for the iso-convergence contours and constant distortion curves (including the tangential critical curve). We also compute the deformation cross section, which is given in closed form for the circular NFW model and in terms of a one-dimensional integral for the elliptical ones. In addition, we provide a simple expression for the ellipticity of the iso-convergence contours of the pseudo-elliptical models and the connection of characteristic convergences among the PNFW and ENFW models. We conclude that the set of solutions derived here is generally accurate for {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashlesssim 0.1{\$}. For low ellipticities, values up to {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashsimeq 0.18{\$} are allowed. On the other hand, the mapping between PNFW and the ENFW models is valid up to {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s \backslashsimeq 0.4{\$}. The solutions derived in this work can be used to speed up numerical codes and ensure their accuracy in the low {\$}\backslashkappa{\_}s{\$} regime, including applications to arc statistics and other strong lensing observables.

abstract = {Halo masses and concentrations have been studied extensively, by means of N-body simulations as well as observationally, during the last decade. Nevertheless, the exact form of the mass-concentration relation is still widely debated. One of the most promising method to estimate masses and concentrations relies on gravitational lensing from massive halos. Here we investigate the impact of the mass-concentration relation on halo peak abundance in weak lensing shear maps relying on the aperture mass method for peak detections. After providing a prescription to take into account the concentration dispersion (always neglected in previous works) in peak number counts predictions, we assess their power to constrain the mass-concentration relation by means of Fisher matrix technique. We find that, when combined with different cosmological probes, peak statistics information from near-future weak lensing surveys provides an interesting and complementary alternative method to lessen the long standing controversy about the mass-concentration relation.},

abstract = {The existence of an arc statistics problem was at the center of a strong debate in the last fifteen years. With the aim to clarify if the optical depth for giant gravitational arcs by galaxy clusters in the so called concordance model is compatible with observations, several studies were carried out which helped to significantly improve our knowledge of strong lensing clusters, unveiling their extremely complex internal structure. In particular, the abundance and the frequency of strong lensing events like gravitational arcs turned out to be a potentially very powerful tool to trace the structure formation. However, given the limited size of observational and theoretical data-sets, the power of arc statistics as a cosmological tool has been only minimally exploited so far. On the other hand, the last years were characterized by significant advancements in the field, and several cluster surveys that are ongoing or planned for the near future seem to have the potential to make arc statistics a competitive cosmological probe. Additionally, recent observations of anomalously large Einstein radii and concentrations in galaxy clusters have reinvigorated the debate on the arc statistics problem. In this paper, we review the work done so far on arc statistics, focussing on what is the lesson we learned and what is likely to improve in the next years.},

abstract = {Integral measures of weak gravitational lensing by dark-matter haloes, like the aperture mass, are sensitive to different physical halo properties dependent on the halo mass density profile. For isothermal profiles, the relation between aperture mass and virial mass is steeper than for haloes with the universal NFW profile. Consequently, the halo mass range probed by the aperture mass is much wider for NFW than for isothermal haloes. We use recent modifications to the Press-Schechter mass function in CDM models normalised to the local abundance of rich clusters, to predict the properties of the halo sample expected to be accessible with the aperture mass technique. While {\~{}}10 haloes should be detected per square degree if the haloes have NFW profiles, their number density is lower by approximately an order of magnitude if they have isothermal profiles. These results depend only very mildly on the cosmological background model. We conclude that counts of haloes with a significant weak-lensing signal are a powerful discriminator between different dark-matter profiles.},

abstract = {This paper exploits the gravitational magnification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to measure properties of dark matter haloes. Gravitationally magnified and de-magnified SNe Ia should be brighter and fainter than average, respectively. The magnification of individual SNe Ia can be computed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halo models. We model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singular isothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeying luminosity-dependent scaling laws. A homogeneously selected sample of 175 SNe Ia from the first 3 yr of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) in the redshift range 0.2 [lsim]z[lsim] 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloes associated with foreground galaxies. The best-fitting velocity dispersion scaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We further find that the normalization of the velocity dispersion of passive and star-forming galaxies are consistent with empirical Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher relations, respectively. If we make no assumption on the normalization of these relations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 per cent confidence level. Using recent models of dust extinction, we deduce that the impact of this effect on our results is very small. We also investigate the brightness scatter of SNe Ia due to gravitational lensing, which has implications for SN Ia cosmology. The gravitational lensing scatter is approximately proportional to the SN Ia redshift. We find the constant of proportionality to be B[{\~{}}=] 0.055+0.039-0.041 mag (B[lsim] 0.12 mag at the 95 per cent confidence level). If this model is correct, the contribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of SNe Ia is small for the SNLS sample. According to the best-fitting dark matter model, gravitational lensing should, however, contribute significantly to the brightness scatter at z{\{}gtrsim{\}} 1.6.},

abstract = {We present the results of a study of weak lensing by galaxies based on 45.5 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} of {\$}R{\_}C{\$} band imaging data from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS). We present the first weak lensing detection of the flattening of galaxy dark matter halos. We use a simple model in which the ellipticity of the halo is {\$}f{\$} times the observed ellipticity of the lens. We find a best fit value of {\$}f=0.77{\^{}}{\{}+0.18{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.21{\}}{\$}, suggesting that the dark matter halos are somewhat rounder than the light distribution. The fact that we detect a significant flattening implies that the halos are well aligned with the light distribution.

This result provides strong support for the existence of dark matter, as an isotropic lensing signal is excluded with 99.5{\%} confidence. We also study the average mass profile around the lenses, using a maximum likelihood analysis. We consider two models for the halo mass profile: a truncated isothermal sphere (TIS) and an NFW profile. We adopt observationally motivated scaling relations between the lens luminosity and the velocity dispersion and the extent of the halo.

abstract = {Splashback refers to the process of matter that is accreting onto a dark matter halo reaching its first orbital apocenter and turning around in its orbit. The cluster-centric radius at which this process occurs, r{\_}sp, defines a halo boundary that is connected to the dynamics of the cluster, in contrast with other common halo boundary definitions such as R{\_}200. A rapid decline in the matter density profile of the halo is expected near r{\_}sp. We measure the galaxy number density and weak lensing mass profiles around RedMapper galaxy clusters in the first year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. For a cluster sample with mean mass {\~{}}2.5 x 10{\^{}}14 solar masses, we find strong evidence of a splashback-like steepening of the galaxy density profile and measure r{\_}sp=1.16 +/- 0.08 Mpc/h, consistent with earlier SDSS measurements of More et al. (2016) and Baxter et al. (2017). Moreover, our weak lensing measurement demonstrates for the first time the existence of a splashback-like steepening of the matter profile of galaxy clusters. We measure r{\_}sp=1.28 +/- 0.18 Mpc/h from the weak lensing data, in good agreement with our galaxy density measurements. Applying our analysis to different cluster and galaxy samples, we find that consistent with LambdaCDM simulations, r{\_}sp scales with R{\_}200m and does not evolve with redshift over the redshift range of 0.3--0.6. We also find that potential systematic effects associated with the RedMapper algorithm may impact the location of r{\_}sp, in particular the choice of scale used to estimate cluster richness. We discuss progress needed to understand the systematic uncertainties and fully exploit forthcoming data from DES and future surveys, emphasizing the importance of more realistic mock catalogs and independent cluster samples.},

abstract = {Strong lensing is a powerful probe of the distribution of matter in the cores of clusters of galaxies. Recent studies suggest that the cold dark matter model predicts cores that are denser than those observed in galaxies, groups and clusters. One possible resolution of the discrepancy is that the dark matter has strong interactions (SIDM), which leads to lower central densities. A generalized form of the Navarro, Frenk and White profile (Zhao profile) may be used to describe these halos. In this paper we examine gravitational lensing statistics for this class of model. The optical depth to multiple imaging is a very sensitive function of the profile parameters in the range of interest for SIDM halos around clusters of galaxies. Less concentrated profiles, which result from larger self-interaction cross-sections, can produce many fewer lensed pairs. Lensing statistics provide a powerful test for SIDM. More realistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to be done, however larger self-interaction cross-sections may well be ruled out by the very existence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster scales. The inclusion of centrally dominant cluster galaxies should boost the cross-section to multiple imaging. However our preliminary calculations suggest that the additional multiple imaging rate is small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging rate for different halo profiles. In future statistical studies, it will be important to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles since the optical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most concentrated members of a cluster population.},

abstract = {In this paper we use a recently compiled data set, which comprises 118 galactic-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems to constrain the statistic property of SGL system, as well as the curvature of universe without assuming any fiducial cosmological model. Based on the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model of SGL system, we obtain that the constrained curvature parameter {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm k{\}}{\$} is close to zero from the SGL data, which is consistent with the latest result of planck measurement. More interestingly, we find that the parameter {\$}f{\$} in the SIE model is strongly correlated with the curvature {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm k{\}}{\$}. Neglecting this correlation in the analysis will significantly overestimate the constraining power of SGL data on the curvature. Furthermore, the obtained constraint on {\$}f{\$} is different from previous results: {\$}f=1.105\backslashpm0.030{\$} ({\$}68\backslash{\%}{\$} C.L.), which means that the standard singular isothermal sphere (SIS) model ({\$}f=1{\$}) is disfavored by the current SGL data at more than {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} confidence level. We also divide the whole SGL data into two parts according to the centric stellar velocity dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm c{\}}{\$} and find that the larger value of {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm c{\}}{\$} the subsample has, the more favored the standard SIS model is. Finally, we extend the SIE model by assuming the power-law density profiles for the total mass density, {\$}\backslashrho=\backslashrho{\_}0(r/r{\_}0){\^{}}{\{}-\backslashalpha{\}}{\$}, and luminosity density, {\$}\backslashnu=\backslashnu{\_}0(r/r{\_}0){\^{}}{\{}-\backslashdelta{\}}{\$}, and obtain the constraints on the power-law indexes: {\$}\backslashalpha=1.95\backslashpm0.04{\$} and {\$}\backslashdelta=2.40\backslashpm0.13{\$} at 68$\backslash${\%} confidence level. When assuming the power-law index {\$}\backslashalpha=\backslashdelta=\backslashgamma{\$}, this scenario is totally disfavored by the current SGL data, {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\_}{\{}\backslashrm min,\backslashgamma{\}} - \backslashchi{\^{}}2{\_}{\{}\backslashrm min,SIE{\}} \backslashsimeq 53{\$}.},

@article{Limousin2005,
abstract = {We present a maximum-likelihood analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing effects in galaxy clusters and in the field. The aim is to determine the accuracy and robustness of constraints that can be obtained on galaxy halo properties in both environments - the high density cluster and the low density field. This paper is theoretically motivated, therefore, we work exclusively with simulated data (nevertheless defined to match observations) to study the accuracy with which input parameters for mass distributions for galaxies can be extracted. We model galaxies in the cluster and the field using a wide range of mass profiles: the truncated pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distribution, the Navarro, Frenk and White profile, and a Power Law model with a core radius. We find that independent of the choice of profile the mean mass of galaxies (of the order of 10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}Mo) can be estimated to within 15{\%} from ground-based data and with an error of less than 10{\%} with space observations. Additionally robust constraints can be obtained on the mean slope of the mass profile. The two standard parameters that characterise galaxy halo models, the central velocity dispersion and the truncation radius can also be retrieved reliably from the maximum-likelihood analysis. Furthermore, going beyond the usual formulation, we propose a re-parameterisation of the mass models that allows us to put yet stronger constraints on the aperture mass of a galaxy halo (with less than 10{\%} error). The gain in signal to noise using space observations, expected for instance with the proposed SNAP satellite compared to ground based data in terms of accuracy of retrieving input parameters is highly significant.},
